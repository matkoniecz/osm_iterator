This code loads .osm file and allows to call function on all OSM objects in dataset.

It is distributed as an `osm_iterator` PyPI package.

Usage example:

```
from osm_iterator.osm_iterator import Data

def show_places(element):
    place_tag = element.get_tag_value("place")
    name_tag = element.get_tag_value("name")
    osm_object_url = element.get_link()
    if place_tag != None:
        print(name_tag + " is an object " + osm_object_url)

osm = Data("file.osm")
osm.iterate_over_data(show_places)
```

Design explanation: this code has deeply suboptimal handling of pretty much everything. For start, all data is loaded into memory and then duplicated in-memory dataset is created.

As result, attempt to process any large datasets will cause issues due to excessive memory consumption.

This situation is consequence of following facts

* This code was written during my first attempt to process OSM data using Python
* API allows (at least in theory) to painlessly switch to real iterator that is not loading all data into memory at once
* So far this was good enough for my purposes so I had no motivation to spend time on improving something that is not a bottleneck

Though, if someone has good ideas (especially in form of a working code) - comments and pull requests are welcomed.

# Running tests

```nosetests3``` or ```python3 -m unittest```


# Publishing new version

- run tests (see section above)
- bump version in `setup.py` file in the top directory
- from the top directory run `python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` and `twine upload dist/*`
- one can make local install, without publishing to PyPi. Run from dist folder command like `pip3 install osm_iterator-0.0.4-py3-none-any.whl`
